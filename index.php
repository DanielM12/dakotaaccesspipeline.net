        <h3>The Dakota Access Pipeline Is Flat-Out Dangerous.</h3>
        <p>The <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong> is a new 1,172-mile pipeline that
          will connect the Bakken and Three Forks production areas in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois.
          The <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong> will make it more profitable for Energy Transfer
          to ship crude oil from North Dakota to existing refineries.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong> is downright dangerous for North Dakotans &mdash;
            especially farmers and others who work off the land.</p>
        <h3>The Dakota Access Pipeline Spill Will Ruin North Dakota's Water Forever</h3>
        <p>The Dakota Access Pipeline will transport approximately 470,000 barrels per day with a capacity
          as high as 570,000 barrels per day or more â€“ which could represent approximately half of Bakken
          current daily crude oil production. <strong>In the event of a spill, all of this oil would be likely
            to seep into the groundwater of North Dakota, ruining agricultural endeavors and poisoning residents.</strong></p>
        <p>Depending upon regulatory approvals, the <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong> is projected to be in
          service by the fourth quarter of 2016.</hp>
