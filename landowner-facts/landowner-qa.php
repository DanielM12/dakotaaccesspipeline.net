            <p><blockquote>“Dakota Access LLC pipeline has filed 23 condemnation suits against 140 individuals, banks and a
  						coal mine to gain easements through North Dakota.  Most of the suits were filed in December against landowners in Williams,
  						Mountrail, McKenzie, Dunn, Mercer and Morton Counties, mostly counties where people are feeling pipeline fatigue from numerous
  						oil and gas pipeline projects.”<cite>"Dakota Access Pipeline Condmenation Lawsuits", Bismarck Tribune, January 1, 2016</cite>

            <h5>Statement by Standing Rock Sioux Tribe on Dakota Access Pipeline:</h5>
            <hr>
            <blockquote>
  						<p>The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will continue to explore all legal, legislative, and administrative options to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline has already led to the
  							destruction of our sacred sites.</p>
  						<p>It is unfortunate that the corporate world chooses to ignore the millions of people and hundreds of tribal nations who stand in opposition to the destruction of our lands, resources, waters, and sacred
  							sites.</p>
  						<p>Energy Transfer Partners has demonstrated time and time again that the bottom line for them is money. The bottom line for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is and will always be protecting our lands, people,
  							water, and sacred sites from the devastation of this pipeline. Our fight isn’t over until there is permanent protection of our people and resources from the pipeline.</p>
