						<h5>The Dakota Access Pipeline Runs Through American Heritage Sites</h5>
						<p>The existing easement is for the Northern Border Pipeline, a smaller natural gas line, with a
							smaller construction footprint.  The easement has never been surveyed for traditional cultural
							properties of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.  The Tribe was not afforded the right to survey the
							corridor for Northern Border and other prior projects, because they were built before the legal
							rights to consultation on traditional cultural properties were issued in 2000.  These rights exist
							today, but were not properly applied with DAPL.   The Tribeâ€™s aboriginal land extends from Wyoming
							to Iowa, and we have historical camps and ceremonial sites throughout the pipeline route.</p>
