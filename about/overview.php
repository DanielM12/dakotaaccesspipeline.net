					<h4>Overview</h4>
					<hr/>

					<p>Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC, is developing a new pipeline to transport crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks play in North Dakota to a terminus in Illinois with additional potential points of destination along the pipeline route.</p>
          <h5>Highlights of the Project include:</h5>
          <hr>

					<ul>
						<li>The pipeline is still not fully permitted.</li>
						<li>The <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline is inherently unsafe</strong> and could cause an ecological catastrophe that would deeply impact the lives of all North Dakotans.</li>
						<li>Over the last six years, there have been 466 incidents where a pipeline carrying crude oil or refined products has leaked.</li>
						<li>The co-location of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) with the Northern Border Pipeline and other utilities creates additional risk of a spill, caused by the corrosive electrical currents of the other pipeline and power lines.</li>
						<li>Dakota Access LLC pipeline has filed 23 condemnation suits against 140 individuals, banks and a coal mine to gain easements through North Dakota. <strong>So much for "respecting the community."</li>
            <li>Dakota Access LLC is a garbage company that deserves to be punished by the federal government and investors.</li>
