					<h2>Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) Facts</h2>
					<hr>
					<p>Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC, is developing
						a new pipeline to transport crude oil from the Bakken/Three Forks play in North Dakota to a terminus
						in Illinois with additional potential points of destination along the pipeline route.</p>
					<p>If you search on Google, chances are you'll be on a website that makes it seem like it's a great idea.
						But &mdash; thing is &mdash; the DAPL is a terrible idea. <strong>The reason why Google says otherwise is that the millionaire Texans
							who run Dakota Access, LLC produce a ton of expensive websites aimed to misinform the everyday people they're taking
							advantage of.</strong></p>
					<p>Here are <strong>the facts</strong> presented alongside some of the lies Dakota Access has been telling online about the
						safety of the DAPL and their legal standing with the Standing Rocking Sioux Tribe:</p>

					<h3>Dakota Access, LLC Sued Hundreds &amp; Took Their Land</h3>
					<hr>
				  <p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>

					<p><blockquote>“The Dakota Access Pipeline traverses a path on private property and does not cross the Standing
						Rock Sioux Tribe’s reservation.  100% of landowners in North Dakota voluntarily signed easements to allow for
						construction of the pipeline on their property.”</blockquote></p>

					<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> Dakota Access DAPL Sued Hundreds of Individuals &amp; Businesses to get what they wanted:</p>

					<p><blockquote>“Dakota Access LLC pipeline has filed 23 condemnation suits against 140 individuals, banks and a
						coal mine to gain easements through North Dakota.  Most of the suits were filed in December against landowners in Williams,
						Mountrail, McKenzie, Dunn, Mercer and Morton Counties, mostly counties where people are feeling pipeline fatigue from numerous
						oil and gas pipeline projects.”<cite>"Dakota Access Pipeline Condmenation Lawsuits", Bismarck Tribune, January 1, 2016</cite>
					</blockquote></p>

					<h3>The Dakota Access Pipeline's Federal Permit Is Not Final</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>

					<p><blockquote>“Nearly the entire route of the 1,172-mile pipeline has been sited and approved by relevant state and federal agencies.”</blockquote></p>

					<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The Army doesn't think so.</p>
					<p><blockquote>"The Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe until it can determine whether it will need to reconsider any of its previous decisions regarding the Lake Oahe site.”
						 <cite>Army Joint Statement, http://bit.ly/2dveZRa</cite></blockquote></p>

					<h3>The Legal Status Of The Dakota Access Pipeline</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>

					<p><blockquote>“To the extent possible, the Dakota Access Pipeline was routed to parallel existing infrastructure, such as the Northern Border
					Pipeline, to avoid environmentally-sensitive areas and areas of potential cultural significance.”</blockquote></p>

					<p><strong>The Truth:</strong> The DAPL cuts right through culturally protected areas.</p>

					<p>The existing easement is for the Northern Border Pipeline, a smaller natural gas line, with a smaller construction footprint.  The easement
						has never been surveyed for traditional cultural properties of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.  The Tribe was not afforded the right to survey
						the corridor for Northern Border and other prior projects, because they were built before the legal rights to consultation on traditional cultural
						properties were issued in 2000.  These rights exist today, but were not properly applied with DAPL.   The Tribe’s aboriginal land extends from
						Wyoming to Iowa, and they have historical camps and ceremonial sites throughout the pipeline route.</p>

					<h3>The DAPL Is Not Safe</h3>
					<hr>
					<p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>
					<p><blockquote>“Designing the route to parallel existing infrastructure mitigates any additional impacts to the environment and avoids areas of potential significance.</blockquote></p>

					<p><strong>The Facts:</strong> Building the Dakota Access Pipeline DAP near existing infrastructure is MORE dangerous.</h4>

					<p>The co-location of DAPL with the Northern Border Pipeline and other utilities creates additional risk of a spill, caused by the corrosive electrical currents of the other
						pipeline and power lines.   Energy Transfer engineers must adapt the DAPL line to the existing currents, or corrosion will occur more rapidly.  Any miscommunication among numerous
						utilities operating in the easement, and the increased potential for human error, intensifies the risk of corrosion and an oil spill.</p>

					<h3>Dakota Access, LLC Has Willfully Destroyed Archaeologically Significant Standing Rock Sites</h3>
					<hr>
				 <p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>

				 <p><blockquote>“Safeguarding and ensuring the longevity of culturally-significant artifacts and sites is of interest to all Americans.  That’s why the Dakota Access Pipeline traverses
					 a path on private property.”</blockquote></p>

				 <p><strong>The Facts:</strong> On September 3, DAPL workers intentionally destroyed a half-dozen burial sites on now-private land, which the Tribe occupied historically.
					 There are numerous other cultural sites of Standing Rock Tribal origin on this land, and DAPL actually purchased the property in order to
					 facilitate construction, to avoid further evaluation and protection of these sites.  The company has acted aggressively to avoid compliance
					 with federal protections of their sacred sites.</p>

				 <h3>American Archaeologists Call Energy Transfer, LLC and Dakota Access Pipeline DAPL Conduct Unprofessional</h3>
				 <hr>
				 <p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>

				 <p><blockquote>“On site there are professional archaeologists who are able to identify and properly identify these sites.”</blockquote></p>

				 <p><strong>The Facts:</strong> How can an Energy Transfer archaeolgist know anything if they never spoke with the tribe?</p>

				 <p>The Society for American Archaeology wrote to the Corps of Engineers that:</p>
				 <p><blockquote>“These stone formations may not be apparent to archaeological surveyors who lack the complete benefit of tribal consultation.”
						 (Sept. 13, 2016).<cite>Society for American Archaeology</cite></blockquote></p>

				 <p>Any claims by archaeologists paid by DAPL regarding the significance of traditional cultural properties are <strong>in violation of
					 the professional standards described by the Society for American Archaeology.</strong></p>

				<h3>The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is a particularly unsafe method of transportation</h3>
				<hr>
				 <p>What Energy Transfer, LLC claims:</p>

				 <p><blockquote>“Pipelines are &mdash; by far &mdash; the safest way to transport energy liquids and gases.  Already, 8 pipelines cross the Missouri River.”</blockquote></p>

				 <p><strong>The Facts:</strong> Crude pipelines are just flat-out dangerous.</p>

				 <p>DAPL is no ordinary pipeline.  It is very large, with a 36 inch diameter and capacity of 570,000 barrels per day – it would significantly increase the total capacity of
					 the pipelines crossing the Missouri River.  DAPL presents a far greater risk to the environment and public health than other, smaller liquid and natural gas lines.
					 Oil pipelines pose more risk to water supplies and have more construction impacts than other methods of transporting oil.</p>

Energy Transfer:

“Once completed, the Dakota Access Pipeline will be among the safest, most technologically advanced pipelines in the world.”

The Facts:

According to Reuters, “Over the last six years, there have been 466 incidents where a pipeline carrying crude oil or refined products has leaked.  Of those, 105, or 22 percent, were detected by an advanced leak system.”  (and.com/nation-world/2016/09/30/technology-designed-to-detect-u-s-energy-pipeline-leaks-often-fails/).  The very leak detection systems relied upon by DAPL have been found to be ineffective. (U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration data).


Energy Transfer:

“The Missouri River intake serving the Tribe is being switched to Mobridge, South Dakota, nearly 50 miles south of the current water intake.”

The Facts:

DAPL suggests there is no threat to Standing Rock’s drinking water supplies because our new intake is further downstream. However, the Reservation has numerous water intakes on the Missouri River and private wells located near the river, immediately downstream from the Lake Oahe crossing of DAPL.  These intakes and wells serve Tribal-member households, irrigation pivots and livestock on the Reservation.  They will face the environmental risk of an oil spill.  The risk is real, and by law must be documented in an Emergency Response Plan.  No emergency plan has been provided to our Tribe.  In any event, DAPL should not question our sincerity or downplay our concerns for our water.


Energy Transfer:

“389 meetings took place between the U.S. Army Corps and 55 tribes. (http://mwalliance.org/tag/standing-rock-sioux-tribe). ”

The Facts:

DAPL misquoted an industry-sponsored web site.  The full quote is “the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had 389 meetings and contacts with Native American Tribes.”  A contact as defined by the Corps could be a missed phone call, or an email.  It is blatantly untrue that there were 389 meetings with Tribes.  In truth, there were two meetings between the Corps of Engineers and Standing Rock Sioux Tribal government officials, a meeting on February 26, 2016 and a hearing on April 29, 2016.   The Standing Rock Tribal Historic Preservation Office made repeated attempts to engage Corps’ archaeologists for the required traditional cultural property surveys along the DAPL pipeline route, but was denied this right.  The federal Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (letter to Corps of Engineers, March 15, 2016) and Society for American Archaeology (letter to Corps of Engineers dated September 13, 2016)    There has been no respectful dialogue.


Energy Transfer:

“Protesters have rushed police lines, threatened and assaulted private security officers (http://www.sayanythingblog.com/entry/law-enforcement-officers-dakota-access-pipeline-protesters-take-precautions-social-media-threats/).”

The Facts:

Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II has insisted from the beginning that protests remain peaceful and lawful.  The Oceti Sakowin Camp prohibits firearms, alcohol and drugs. (http:www.kfyrtv.com/content/news/Dakota-Access-Pipeline-protesters-say-the-only-weapon-they-have-with-them-is-prayer-360635222.html).   In mischaracterizing the protests and engaging in innuendo against Indians at the Oceti Sakowin camp, DAPL cites an individual’s blog that is known for engaging in anti-Indian rhetoric and stereotypes, and is not a credible source of information.

On August 30 and September 1, Tribal cultural specialists were permitted by a private landowner to survey the pipeline area, and they discovered numerous burial and funerary sites.  This was reported to the federal judge.  On September 3, DAPL workers appeared at that site with heavy equipment and purposely trenched this very area.  Unprofessional individuals with German shepherds purported to be security for DAPL, but they lacked control over the dogs, precipitating a confrontation in which numerous Indians were bitten.
