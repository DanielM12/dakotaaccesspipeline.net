					<h3>Dakota Access Pipeline Community Abuses</h3>
					<hr/>

					<p>Energy Transfer Partners’ <strong>Dakota Access Pipeline</strong> (DAPL) project claims to be:
            <blockquote>...dedicated to partnering with the communities along the route and throughout the states in which they operate.  We will use local labor where possible in construction of the pipeline, providing economic activity in the short-term, generating considerable tax revenue, and directly reducing this nation’s need for oil imported from sometimes unfriendly foreign nations.  And we are also committed to doing right by those landowners along the route.</blockquote>
